                <h2>Explain your Capstone:</h2>
                <p>With this Front-End Capstone, we were assgined to build up a storefront. I decided to jump in and focus on the React Code that would make my website functional. I styled it to be more of a wholesale / minimalistic styled site.</p>
                <h2>What did you learn throughout your time here:</h2>
                <p>Just looking back on the past 3-4 months I've been in this class, we've covered the basics of HTML, CSS / SCSS, javascript, and react javascript. Its cool to see everything I have learned these past few months come together in our react projects and in the devshop.</p>
                <h2>Explain your favorite languages and why:</h2>
                <p>I'm not sure if I have a favorite language but there sure are languages I'm more comfortable with than others haha. I feel like I have a good understanding on HTML and SCSS, and I feel pretty comfortable using it. I feel like there's still a lot I need to learn in React I would say it is one of my favorite languages because of all you can do with it.</p>
